        <p>Hi, my name is Ernesto, I'm 28 years old. I'm from San Miguel, El Salvador. I served as a
            full time missionary in the Tegucigalpa Honduras mission, from 2017 to 2019. My current
            job is as an Client Experience Specialist, providing support and project oversight in
            the telecom industry. Previously I have worked in Tech Support / Customer Support roles.
            <br><br>
            I love computers and everything related to them. My dream job is to be a Software
            Developer. I haven take some classes and courses in the past, but never got a Bachelor's
            degree. My biggest hope is to get the Bachelor's Degree in Software Development and get
            a job as a full time Software Developer.
