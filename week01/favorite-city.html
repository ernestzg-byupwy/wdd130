    <h1>Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is San Miguel, located in the eastern part of El Salvador. The weather is
        usually hot, although in December and January it might get a little cold and windy early in
        the mornings. </p>
    <p>I like San Salvador too, the capital, because it has more malls and stores to visit,
        and most of the tech related jobs are in the capital, but I still prefer San Miguel, because
        the pace is a little slow, less traffic, less yelling, less stress.</p>
